A tool set for R programming and data analysis


## Installation

You can install the development version of Rtoolset from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("wbvguo/Rtoolset")
```

## Example

## create a dir when it does not exist
```{r example}
library(Rtoolset)
make_dir("~/test/")
```



<!-- ## Legacy -->
<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots. In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
