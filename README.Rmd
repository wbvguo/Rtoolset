A miscellaneous tool set for R programming and data analysis


## Installation

You can install the development version of Rtoolset from [GitHub](https://github.com/wbvguo/Rtoolset.git) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("wbvguo/Rtoolset")
```

## Example

## Folder & files
###  create a dir when it does not exist
```{r example}
library(Rtoolset)
mkdir("~/test/")
```


### save to pdf
```{r}
save2pdf(file = "./man/figures/save2pdf.pdf", width = 6, height = 6, overwrite = TRUE,
         plot_code = quote({
           t = seq(0, 100, 1)
           plot(cos(t) + t*sin(t), sin(t) - t* cos(t), type = "l", asp = 1)
         }))
```

### print
```{r}
print_pval(0.0000123)
```

```{r}
vec2print(c("apple", "banana"))
```


<!-- ## Legacy -->
<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots. In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
